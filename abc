Platform	Data Support	Rating	Development Perspective	Disadvantage
Snowflake	Structured, Semi-Structured	High	Fully supports structured (tables, SQL) and semi-structured data (JSON, Avro, Parquet) via native support and flexible schemas.	Lacks native support for unstructured data (e.g., images, videos); requires external tools for handling these.
Databricks	Structured, Semi-Structured, Unstructured	High	Built for all data types with native support for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data through Delta Lake and Apache Spark.	Managing unstructured data (e.g., videos) at scale may require additional tools and complex configurations.
Google BigQuery	Structured, Semi-Structured	High	Optimized for structured data and semi-structured data with built-in support for JSON and arrays. Integrates with GCS for unstructured data storage.	Unstructured data requires external preprocessing or storage in GCS before analysis.
Oracle Autonomous DB	Structured, Semi-Structured	Moderate	Handles structured data and limited semi-structured data (JSON, XML). Provides advanced features for relational data processing.	Unstructured data support is minimal and not natively supported for analytics.
Azure Synapse	Structured, Semi-Structured	Moderate	Supports structured and semi-structured data (via PolyBase for JSON, Avro). Integrates with Azure Data Lake for unstructured data.	Direct unstructured data processing is limited; external services are required for analysis.
Amazon Redshift	Structured, Semi-Structured	Moderate	Provides structured and semi-structured support (via Redshift Spectrum for JSON, Parquet). Integrates with S3 for unstructured data.	Native support for unstructured data is limited; depends on S3 for storage and access.
