Platform	Scalability & Performance Support	Rating	Development Perspective	Disadvantage
Snowflake	High	High	Offers automatic scaling of compute and storage independently; supports elastic performance for varying workloads. Ideal for handling structured and semi-structured data at scale.	Concurrency limits under high user load can require manual resource scaling adjustments.
Databricks	High	High	Built on Apache Spark, optimized for massive parallel processing; scales efficiently for both batch and streaming workloads. Supports auto-scaling clusters for dynamic workloads.	High cost for scaling large compute clusters during resource-intensive operations.
Google BigQuery	High	High	Serverless architecture automatically scales storage and compute independently; optimized for low-latency queries even with large datasets.	Performance can degrade slightly with complex nested queries or insufficient partitioning.
Oracle Autonomous DB	Moderate	Moderate	Automatically optimizes resources using machine learning for predictable workloads. Scales effectively for OLTP and OLAP workloads.	Scaling flexibility is limited compared to cloud-native architectures like Snowflake or BigQuery.
Azure Synapse	Moderate	Moderate	Supports on-demand and provisioned resource scaling; integrates with Azure Data Lake for scalable storage. Best for mixed analytics and big data workloads.	Scaling for high-concurrency workloads requires manual tuning and may not match dynamic needs.
Amazon Redshift	Moderate	Moderate	Provides concurrency scaling for burst workloads and RA3 nodes for storage scaling; suited for large-scale OLAP workloads.	Performance for real-time queries may lag without additional configurations (e.g., Redshift Spectrum).
