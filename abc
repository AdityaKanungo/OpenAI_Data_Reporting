Platform	Avoiding Data Duplication Support	Rating	Technical Details	Disadvantage
Snowflake	Yes	High	Leverages zero-copy cloning and data sharing to avoid physical data duplication. Supports shared metadata and optimized storage.	Requires Snowflake-specific architecture; challenging to integrate with external systems efficiently.
Databricks	Yes	High	Uses Delta Lake with versioning and time travel to avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining history.	Delta Lake versioning can increase metadata overhead, impacting performance with large datasets.
Google BigQuery	Yes	High	Supports views and materialized views to avoid duplication; uses separation of storage and compute.	Materialized views require periodic refreshes, which may create temporary redundancies.
Oracle Autonomous DB	Yes	Moderate	Avoids duplication via database links and schema-level optimizations; supports references to external tables.	Schema-level optimizations are Oracle-specific, limiting integration with other ecosystems.
Azure Synapse	Yes	Moderate	Prevents duplication through external tables and PolyBase, enabling querying of external data without replication.	PolyBase configurations can be complex, and storage inefficiencies may still arise in certain cases.
Amazon Redshift	Yes	Moderate	Avoids duplication using views and materialized views; supports Spectrum for querying external data.	Materialized views create storage overhead and require management to avoid redundant copies.
