Snowflake	Yes	High	Supports automatic schema detection for semi-structured data (JSON, Parquet). Allows schema evolution through flexible table structures and dynamic columns.	Schema changes may require manual adjustment in downstream queries or views.
Databricks	Yes	High	Delta Lake provides schema enforcement and evolution for structured and semi-structured data, with APIs to handle schema updates seamlessly.	Schema evolution can be resource-intensive, especially with large datasets or frequent changes.
Google BigQuery	Yes	High	Automatically detects and adapts to schema changes for semi-structured data; supports schema evolution through DDL commands.	Changes to schema in active datasets may require manual repartitioning or query updates.
Oracle Autonomous DB	Limited	Moderate	Supports limited schema evolution via SQL DDL commands; focuses on structured data with constraints for integrity.	No native schema evolution for semi-structured or unstructured data; requires manual intervention.
Azure Synapse	Yes	Moderate	Allows schema evolution through PolyBase for external tables and integrates with Azure Data Factory for change handling.	Schema evolution support is limited to external services; lacks native capabilities for seamless updates.
Amazon Redshift	Limited	Moderate	Supports basic schema evolution through ALTER TABLE commands and Spectrum for semi-structured data schema inference.	Schema updates can disrupt queries and require manual updates for dependent views and tables.
