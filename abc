Platform	Real-Time Support	Rating	Technical Details	Disadvantage
Snowflake	Yes	Moderate	Supports real-time ingestion using Snowpipe and Snowpipe Streaming; optimized for semi-structured data (JSON, Parquet).	Primarily optimized for batch processing; streaming can have higher latencies compared to alternatives.
Databricks	Yes	High	Built on Apache Spark, provides Structured Streaming; excels in real-time processing for both batch and stream data.	Higher cost for real-time workloads due to compute-intensive Spark architecture.
Google BigQuery	Yes	High	Real-time ingestion via Streaming API; integrates with Pub/Sub and Dataflow for low-latency analytics.	Streaming ingestion incurs extra costs, and schema changes require downtime.
Oracle Autonomous DB	Yes	High	Real-time ingestion with automated optimization; supports complex analytics with ML-driven automation and scalability.	Complex setup for integrations with non-Oracle tools or external platforms.
Azure Synapse	Yes	Moderate	Integrates with Azure Stream Analytics; best suited for batch workloads but configurable for real-time scenarios.	Higher latency for real-time streaming compared to Databricks or BigQuery; requires manual tuning.
Amazon Redshift	Yes	Moderate	Uses Kinesis Firehose for near real-time ingestion; requires additional configurations for low-latency performance.	Limited native real-time capabilities; heavily reliant on external tools for real-time processing.
