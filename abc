Platform	Data Sharing Support	Rating	Technical Details	Disadvantage
Snowflake	Yes	High	Supports secure data sharing without data duplication using Data Sharing and Data Clean Rooms. Shares data across accounts and clouds.	Limited to Snowflake accounts; cross-platform sharing requires additional setup or ETL processes.
Databricks	Yes	Moderate	Data sharing via Delta Sharing, an open protocol for secure sharing of Delta Lake tables; supports cross-platform sharing.	Limited adoption of Delta Sharing; not as seamless as Snowflake for multi-cloud environments.
Google BigQuery	Yes	High	Offers BigQuery Omni for cross-cloud sharing and dataset-level sharing with detailed access controls.	Sharing between non-Google platforms requires additional configurations and cost implications.
Oracle Autonomous DB	Yes	Moderate	Data sharing supported within the Oracle ecosystem using Data Pump and Oracle GoldenGate for replication.	Lacks seamless multi-cloud sharing; heavily tied to Oracle products.
Azure Synapse	Yes	Moderate	Enables sharing via Azure Data Share, allowing secure sharing with Azure services and external accounts.	Limited to Azure ecosystem; cross-cloud sharing can be cumbersome.
Amazon Redshift	Yes	Moderate	Data sharing through Redshift Data Sharing, allowing near real-time sharing across clusters in the same AWS account.	Restricted to same-region or account sharing; cross-platform or multi-cloud sharing requires ETL.
