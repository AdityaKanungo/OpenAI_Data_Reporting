Platform	Disaster Recovery Support	Rating	Development Perspective	Disadvantage
Snowflake	Yes	High	Provides time travel and fail-safe features for point-in-time recovery of data; supports cross-region and cross-cloud replication.	Fail-safe period is limited to 7 days and is not user-configurable for extended recovery needs.
Databricks	Yes	High	Supports Delta Lake versioning for rollback and recovery, along with cluster snapshots for state restoration. Integrates with cloud-native disaster recovery features.	Custom setup for cross-region disaster recovery can be complex and requires additional configurations.
Google BigQuery	Yes	High	Built-in high availability and disaster recovery with automatic replication across multiple regions. Supports recovery through backups and versioned tables.	No user control over replication and recovery configurations; fully managed by Google.
Oracle Autonomous DB	Yes	High	Offers Active Data Guard for real-time data replication and failover across regions. Supports automated backups and recovery.	Disaster recovery heavily relies on Oracle ecosystem, limiting flexibility for hybrid cloud setups.
Azure Synapse	Yes	Moderate	Disaster recovery through geo-redundant backups and integration with Azure Recovery Services. Supports active geo-replication for critical workloads.	Manual intervention often required for failover and recovery in complex setups.
Amazon Redshift	Yes	Moderate	Supports cross-region snapshots and automated backups for recovery. Offers integration with AWS services like S3 for disaster recovery.	Recovery times can be longer for large datasets or if additional configurations arenâ€™t preemptively applied.
