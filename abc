Platform	Row-Level Security Support	Column-Level Security Support	Rating	Technical Details	Disadvantage
Snowflake	Yes	Yes	High	Implements Row Access Policies to enforce row-level security and Dynamic Data Masking for column-level security.	Complex policies can become challenging to manage in large-scale deployments.
Databricks	Yes	Yes	Moderate	Supports row-level and column-level security through ACLs (Access Control Lists) and table permissions.	Granular access control requires manual configuration, increasing administrative overhead.
Google BigQuery	Yes	Yes	High	Provides Row-Level Security policies and Column-Level Security using policy tags and access controls.	Policy management can be complex when dealing with large numbers of tables and datasets.
Oracle Autonomous DB	Yes	Yes	High	Utilizes Virtual Private Database (VPD) for row-level security and Oracle Label Security (OLS) for column-level security.	Configuration complexity may require specialized DBA skills for effective implementation.
Azure Synapse	Yes	Yes	High	Employs Row-Level Security (RLS) and Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) for column-level security within SQL pools.	Limited support for certain data sources may necessitate additional configurations.
Amazon Redshift	Yes	Yes	Moderate	Implements Row-Level Security through SQL-based policies and Column-Level Security via GRANT and REVOKE statements.	Manual policy management can be error-prone and lacks automation features present in other platforms.
