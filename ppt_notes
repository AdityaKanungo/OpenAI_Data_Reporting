Slide 2: Introduction

    Topic: Setting the Stage
    Content:
        "In the modern data-driven world, the ability to quickly retrieve and analyze data is crucial."
        "SQL remains the cornerstone for interacting with relational databases, yet crafting SQL queries can be time-consuming and error-prone."
        "Our SQL Query Generator harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT models to translate natural language prompts into accurate SQL queries."
        "Let's dive into how this tool can optimize your workflow, reduce errors, and make SQL querying more accessible."

Slide 3: System Architecture

    Topic: Understanding the Building Blocks
    Content:
        "Our system is structured into four main components:"
            "User Interface: Built with Streamlit, it provides a user-friendly web interface for inputting prompts and viewing results."
            "OpenAI API: This is the brain of our operation, interfacing with OpenAI to generate and review SQL queries based on user input."
            "SQL Execution Engine: Responsible for running the generated SELECT queries against your database and displaying the results."
            "Visualization Component: Integrated within the UI, it allows for immediate plotting and analysis of query results."
        "This modular approach ensures a smooth and efficient user experience from start to finish."

Slide 4: From Prompt to SQL Query

    Topic: The Journey of a User Prompt
    Content:
        "The process starts when a user uploads their database metadata and inputs a query request in natural language."
        "Our system sends this input to the OpenAI API, where the GPT model generates a preliminary SQL query."
        "This query undergoes a review phase to ensure it adheres to SQL standards and optimally utilizes the database's structure."
        "The finalized query is then presented back to the user, ready for execution or further modification."

Slide 5: SQL Execution and Visualization

    Topic: Bringing Queries to Life
    Content:
        "With the generated query in hand, users can execute it directly within our tool if it’s a SELECT statement."
        "The results are displayed in a clear, tabular format, and users have the option to download the results for offline analysis."
        "For analytical queries, users can leverage our visualization component to instantly generate plots and charts, aiding in data interpretation and insights."

Slide 6: Advantages and Use Cases

    Topic: Why Choose Our SQL Query Generator?
    Content:
        "Our tool dramatically reduces the time and effort required to create SQL queries, especially for users who may not be SQL experts."
        "It enhances accuracy and consistency in query generation, minimizing the risk of errors."
        "Practical applications span various domains, including business analytics, academic research, and data science education."
        "By streamlining the SQL querying process, we empower users to focus more on data analysis and less on query syntax."

Slide 7: Challenges and Future Directions

    Topic: Navigating the Road Ahead
    Content:
        "While our tool is powerful, it's important to acknowledge its limitations, especially when dealing with highly complex queries or specific database dialects."
        "Our ongoing development efforts are geared towards enhancing the tool’s capabilities, supporting a wider array of database systems, and continually improving user experience."
        "We are also exploring ways to integrate additional AI-driven features, such as query optimization suggestions and natural language explanations of SQL queries."
