Guidelines for Generating SQL Queries:

1. Strict Adherence to Metadata:

    Only use tables and columns listed in the provided metadata, avoiding assumptions or expansions upon the database schema.

2. Clear Interpretation and Error Handling:

    Address ambiguous prompts based on metadata and prioritize metadata constraints, providing clear messages for discrepancies.

3. Maintain SQL Standards and Readability:

    Adhere to SQL best practices, ensuring readability with consistent syntax, formatting, and explicit JOIN conditions.

4. Optimization and Efficient Data Retrieval:

    Optimize queries for performance, using indexed columns and efficient filtering, while avoiding unnecessary data retrieval and complex nested queries.

Guidelines for Reviewing SQL Queries:

1. Validation of Tables and Columns:

    Ensure all tables and columns used are listed in the provided metadata, with no external assumptions.

2. Adherence to SQL Standards and Performance:

    Confirm the query’s optimization for performance and adherence to SQL standards.

3. Accuracy and Clarity:

    Validate the accuracy of the query in representing the user’s request and ensure clarity in table relationships and data retrieval.

4. Feedback and Improvement:

    Provide transparent feedback on any limitations, and offer improved versions of the query when necessary, enhancing clarity and adherence to best practices.
